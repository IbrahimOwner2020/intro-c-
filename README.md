# README

This Git repository contains my journey of learning C++. 

## Introduction

I have started this repository to document my progress in learning C++. As a beginner, I wanted to have a place where I can keep all my code and notes organized, and also share my journey with others who might be interested in learning C++.

## Contents

The repository contains the following files and directories:

- `README.md`: This file, which provides an introduction and overview of the repository.
- `src/`: A directory that contains all the C++ code that I have written so far.
- `notes/`: A directory that contains notes and documentation on various topics related to C++ that I have learned.

## Learning resources

I have used various resources to learn C++, including:

- Online courses on Udemy and Coursera
- Books, such as "C++ Primer" by Lippman, Lajoie, and Moo
- Online tutorials and documentation, such as cppreference.com
